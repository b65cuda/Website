        <h1>CSCI 434 Mastery Assignment</h1>
        <p>This site highlights various course objectives. All pages share the same header and footer. 
            The header navigation is a drop down on smaller devices and horizontal links on larger devices.
            A strong emphasis was placed on keeping things simple, writing easy to understand, clean code,
            and ensuring a responsive layout natively without using any frameworks. If you have edge set to dark mode
            or your windows app default is dark, this site will have a back background. Otherwise it will be white.</p>

        <h2>ID page</h2>
        <p>The ID page features a table with name, description, and photo of select southwestern birds of prey.</p>
        <h2>Media page</h2>
        <p>The Media page features text and embedded video. Of note, is that the video will resize down to the smallest device. This is not normally possible with the default YouTube embed script.</p>
        <h2>Links page</h2>
        <p>The links page features a two column layout on larger devices and a single column on smaller devices. This was achieved with media queries.</p>
        <h2>FAQs page</h2>
        <p>The FAQ page features an accordion style drop down with some javascript.</p>
        <h2>About page</h2>
        <p>The about page is the original assignment page with text, links, and photos.</p>
