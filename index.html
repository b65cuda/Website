<h1>Anthony Dickerson</h1>
<h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Anthony Dickerson. I love in Yuma, AZ with my wife and three kids, and countless animals.
        As of October 1st 2021, I have officially retired from the U.S. Air Force as a C-130 Loadmaster.
        I currently attend Southwestern College, and plan to graduate spring of 2022 with a Computer Science major.</p>

    <p>My free time is spent homeschooling my kids, and keeping involved with the <a href="https://www.yumaorchestra.org/">Yuma Orchestra Association</a>.</p>

    <p>    I have been the Commander of Cadets for my local <a href="https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/">Civil Air Patrol</a> for the last four years, but am stepping down as my kids are no longer involved.</p>

    <p>I am on the board for a local wildlife rehab non-profit <a href="https://azvida.org/">Vida Wildlife</a>. We mostly deal in birds of prey, 
        and I am known in AZ as the Kestrel King. Kestrels are very small falcons, but they are fierce and love me for some reason. 
        I have a very high success rate raising them, so every spring, all of the lost rehab babies get transported down to me, and I raise my Army.</p>
