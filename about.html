        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone, my name is Anthony Dickerson. I live in Yuma, AZ with my wife and three kids, and countless animals.
            As of October 1st 2021, I have officially retired from the U.S. Air Force as a C-130 Loadmaster.
            I currently attend Southwestern College, and plan to graduate spring of 2022 with a Computer Science major.</p>
    
        <p>My free time is spent homeschooling my kids, and keeping involved with the <a href="https://www.yumaorchestra.org/">Yuma Orchestra Association</a>.</p>

        <p>I have been the Commander of Cadets for my local <a href="https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/">Civil Air Patrol</a> for the last four years, 
            but am stepping down as my kids are no longer involved.</p>
            <img src="img/civilairpatrol.jpg" alt="Civil Air Patrol Cessna 182">
        <p>I am on the board for a local wildlife rehab non-profit <a href="https://azvida.org/">Vida Wildlife</a>. We mostly deal in birds of prey, 
            and I am known in AZ as the Kestrel King. Kestrels are very small falcons, but they are fierce and love me for some reason. 
            I have a very high success rate raising them, so every spring, all of the lost rehab babies get transported down to me, and I raise my Army.</p>
